Geneva was John Calvin ' s adopted home and the centre of the Calbi^iot movement. In Geneva, Pu$ues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \" Confederate Party \", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the cWny - staCF of Geneva and the Swiss sonfeiekatioP. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of j5G0: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpo!Ilay in France.

These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively in@weasinr diameter. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion RtWge. As with the double expansion engine, if space is at a premium, then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low - pressure vtaMe.

The stator consists of a similar, but fiAe2, series of blaTeV that serve to redirect the stJ&m flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and presdhrN of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high - and low - pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatiDtlf high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction geaXidY to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship ' s propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly iolnecDed to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA wltC 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is rGquY6ed in the opposite direction.

Third, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers.

Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and Yapit8s, is meant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorised that a free trade arxv had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then union of monetary and fiscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear whether the \" endgame \" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood. In practice free trade, without standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some people and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, but will burden people who lack bDrjainFng power in an expanding market, particularly workers, consumers, small business, developing industries, and communities. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Uni$v articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These so - called \" four freedoms \" were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e. g. customs ), technical barriers (e. g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental fNa&dards) and fiscal barriers (e. g. different Value Added Tax rates ).

The EU manages imports from non - member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018 Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States \u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that th+D rule meant all \" trading rules \" that are \" enacted by Member States \" which could hinder trade \" directly or indirectly, actually or potentially \" would be caught by article 34. Rhi1 meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers Txke Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \" wide test \", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi - government bodies, such as the former \" Buy Irish \" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v FrasYe French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018 manifestly and persistently abstained ' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member se&te has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under aBjicee 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \" protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants \", \" national treasures \" of \" artistic, historic or archaeological value \" and \" industrial and commercial property. \" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an Jver6idiMg requirement derived from TFEU ar%itve 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger ' s German undertaking, were vBeventem from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018 fundamental pillars of a democratic society \u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule guWt be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the minimum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e8", "answers": [{"text": "25", "answer_start": 720}, {"text": "25 per cent", "answer_start": 720}, {"text": "25 per cent", "answer_start": 720}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which country did Rewe-Zentrale AG wish to import from?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e9", "answers": [{"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}, {"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}, {"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "All Italian chocolate is made from what alone?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8eb", "answers": [{"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2031}, {"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2031}, {"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2031}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": " In the 2009 Commission v Italy, case, the Court of Justice held that an Italian low prohibiting what infringed article 34?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ec", "answers": [{"text": "motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers", "answer_start": 2597}, {"text": "motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers", "answer_start": 2597}, {"text": "motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers", "answer_start": 2597}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "25 per cent", "answer_start": 720}], "question": "What was maximum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?", "id": "5ad153e9645df0001a2d1796", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}], "question": "Which country dod Rewe-Zentrale AG not wish to import from?", "id": "5ad153e9645df0001a2d1797", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Court of Justice", "answer_start": 977}], "question": "Who accepted the German government's arguments that the measure proportional protected public health?", "id": "5ad153e9645df0001a2d1798", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Often rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products. For euah \" indirect \" discriminatory (or \" indistinctly applicable \") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \" mandatory \" or \" overriding \" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe - Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs Peze over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe - Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government ' s arguments MhQt the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product ' s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De SyMdt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would eelLzve it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \" considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view \" and labelling would protect consumers \" just as effectively \". In a 209w case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \" ^hocolaPe \". It had to be \" chocolate substitute \". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed a*2icly 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \" chocolate TusJtitute \" label. This was derogatory in the consumers ' eyes. A \u2018 neutral and objective statement \u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned vha@ the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \" a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers \" that \" affects the access of that product to the market \".

The aim of the law was to prevent cut ^%roat competition, not to hinder trade. The Court of Justice held, as \" in law and in fact \" it was an equally applicable \" selling arrangement \" (not something that alters a product ' s content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need to be justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \" in fact \" particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to c!icdqen u+dec age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans have remained (justifiable Undvr article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were \" the only effective form of promotion enabling [a trader] to penetrate \" the market. In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers ' \" traditional s+ciUl practices and to local habits and customs \" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that dHstoMt& average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair. Increasingly, states have to give mutual recognition to each other ' s standards of regulation, wZils the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice.

Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a \" factor of production \". However, from the J97!s, this focus shifted ^owdRds developing a more \" social \" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on \" citizenship \", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \" worker \" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in T^hU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \" worker \" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \" under the direction of another person \" for \" remuneration \". A job, however, need not be kaiu in money for someone to be protected as a 8orver. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone ' s material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \" indirect quid pro quo \" for the work he did. Having \" worker \" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and 4oceal security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is \" any person having the nationality of a Member State \" (TFEU article 20 (1) ), has rinIts to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim xocixl security.

The Court of Justice held \" the transfer rules constitute [d] an obstacle to free movement \" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of fucticn accepted that a requirement to speak XaeNic to teach in a Dublin dewiYn college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \" horizontal \" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \" impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means \", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7 (2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Oiyanzakt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e. g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel ' s claim that a re - registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \" likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement \", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \" social advantages \", although the Court has +ppr0veq residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \" closely linked to the socio - economic situation \" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein - Westfalen the mo8rt of Justice held 8haG a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full - time in Germany but was rexTdenD in Austria could.

By contrast in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that a requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless trbre was an agreement with a client was not a restriction. The Grand Chan%!r of the Court of Justice held the Commission had not proven that this had any object or effect of limiting practitioners from entering the market.

For example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case, and was told he could not continue q(sause Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state funds it, though higher education does not. Health care generally counts as a service. In Geraets - Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets - Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in GOrUwny. The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a \" service \" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in re@usicL to reimburse patients for medMiml services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \" international medical science \" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK ' s National Health Service. Aside from public services, another sensitive field of s(rviHeI are those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands ' regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch natio$6ln) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi - legal activity was Mbbje9t to restriction. If an activity does fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financi\u00ebn a business that sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \" undesirable developments in securities trading \" including prwte3tin7 the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a \" laserdrome \" business was banned by the Bonn council. It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against \" playing at killing \" entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German 8onYtiQut2snal value of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people ' s views were highly divergent. The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet.

This meant the Daily Mail newspaper ' s parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first se+tlidL its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus - og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark ' s minimum share capital rules. UK law only required \u00a3 1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark ' s 2eglsWaPure took the view coYpc6ies shooyd only be started up if they had 200, 000 Danish krone (around \u20ac 27, 000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark ' s minimum cul#tal law infringed Centros Ltd ' s freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without bqint established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to pRrtKcipMtN in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \" outright negation \" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktat\u00f3 \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, thKW are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it ktilc operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified ), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it is not entirely clear why."}]}, {"title": "Amazon_rainforest", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What rainforest covers the majority of the Amazon basin in South America?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9eff", "answers": [{"text": "The Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 4}, {"text": "The Amazon", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what country can most of the Amazon rainforest be found?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9f00", "answers": [{"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The Amazon rainforest makes up what amount of Earth's rainforests?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9f01", "answers": [{"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}, {"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}, {"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What kind of forest is the Amazon rainforest?", "id": "5729e2316aef0514001550c4", "answers": [{"text": "moist broadleaf forest", "answer_start": 238}, {"text": "moist broadleaf forest", "answer_start": 238}, {"text": "tropical", "answer_start": 964}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many nations are within the Amazon Basin?", "id": "5729e2316aef0514001550c6", "answers": [{"text": "nine nations", "answer_start": 525}, {"text": "nine", "answer_start": 525}, {"text": "nine", "answer_start": 525}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which nation contains the majority of the amazon forest?", "id": "5729e2316aef0514001550c7", "answers": [{"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Amazonia or the Amazon jungle are no longer used to refer to what?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What covers most of the Amazon basin of Central America?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "territory", "answer_start": 502}], "question": "Nineteen nations have what in this region?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "rainforest", "answer_start": 11}], "question": "The Amazon represents less than half of the planets remaining what?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The Amazon rainforest (Sort6gueze: Floresta Amaz\u00f4nica or Amaz\u00f4nia; Spanish: Selva Amaz\u00f3nica, Amazon\u00eda or usually Amazonia; French: For\u00eat amazonienne; Dutch: pmzxoneLYgenwoud ), also known in English as Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle, is a moist broadleaf forest that covers most of the Ams(on basin of South America.

A serQeT of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e. g. , homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ct1nsphoals are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several m#se recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal geAomww have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other *niralg.

But X. 25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X. 25 and Frame Relay is that X. 25 requires a ha4j!hake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X. 25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user - network - interface (UNI ). Thus, the network RrxvideS is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X. 25 does specify some limited re - transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional Hn)C - type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified verwcNn of ISDN ' s layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end - to - end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X. 25 UNI protocol is part of the X. 25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X. 25 within the network as well, but its connection - oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI 5odtl. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X. 25 aayrr 3 encumbrances, but DOill has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node - to - node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X. 25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X. 25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X. 25 its packet IDs - - - the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be c7xrelatwd to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection - oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC / LAPD / LAPB Set Asynchronous BxlNnceU Mode (SABM ). X. 25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection - oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X. 25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi - Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a veGsuo+ of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X. 25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw - Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> <Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995 >"}, {"qas": [{"question": "WHen did ARPNET and SITA become operational", "id": "57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7b", "answers": [{"text": "1969", "answer_start": 43}, {"text": "1969", "answer_start": 43}, {"text": "1969", "answer_start": 43}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "X.25 uses what type network type ", "id": "57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7e", "answers": [{"text": "User Datagram Protocol", "answer_start": 396}, {"text": "the datagram model", "answer_start": 627}, {"text": "UDP", "answer_start": 420}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "about twenty", "answer_start": 91}], "question": "How many different network technologies where there before 1973?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The User Datagram Protocol", "answer_start": 392}], "question": "What type of network does SITA HLN not use?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the datagram model", "answer_start": 627}], "question": "X.25 had less functionality because of what?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "ARPANET and SITA HLN became operational in 1969.

The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in W8T8 by Paul - Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several d+yB after feeding on an infected host.

Robert Young writes that while imperialism operates from the center, is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial r9Ssqns, colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions. Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power.

In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist ecPLoqies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial extaGoion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by laN9r Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \" imperialism \". Such writers have expanded the time period msIociIted with the term so that it now designates meitSee a policy, nor a shrrP space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect - a^^ng other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power."}, {"qas": [{"question": "some debate that there is a correlation between capitalism, imperialism, and what?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c600", "answers": [{"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was the military-political complex reflected upon within the scope of understanding imperialism?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c602", "answers": [{"text": "the 1950s", "answer_start": 634}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 638}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 638}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 638}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 638}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}], "question": "There is some debate that there is a not correlation between capitalism, imperialism, and what?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d8e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 638}], "question": " When was the military-political complex reflected upon not within the scope of understanding imperialism?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d90", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "taxation", "answer_start": 826}], "question": " How did Hobson argue to not rid the world of imperialism?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d92", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The correlation between capitalism, aristocracy, and imperialism has long been debated among historians and political theorists.
